# scaler-ml-ai-challenge


Problem Scenario:
A member in your Discord community is seeking help with a machine learning project but is facing a challenge in choosing the right evaluation metric for their classification model. They have tried using accuracy, but they suspect it might not be the most suitable metric for their imbalanced dataset. The dataset contains 90% instances of class A and only 10% instances of class B.

Task:
As a Discord mod and doubt solver specializing in machine learning, guide the member on choosing an appropriate evaluation metric for their classification model and explain why accuracy might not be the best choice for an imbalanced dataset.

Hints:

Suggest alternative evaluation metrics that are more suitable for imbalanced datasets.
Explain the limitations of accuracy in the context of imbalanced datasets.
Highlight the importance of choosing the right evaluation metric based on the specific problem and dataset characteristics.
