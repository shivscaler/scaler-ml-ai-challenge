Q1. Problem Scenario:
A member in your Discord community is seeking help with a machine learning project but is facing a challenge in choosing the right evaluation metric for their classification model. They have tried using accuracy, but they suspect it might not be the most suitable metric for their imbalanced dataset. The dataset contains 90% of class A and only 10% of class B.

Task:
As a Discord mod and doubt solver specializing in machine learning, guide the member on choosing an appropriate evaluation metric for their classification model and explain why accuracy might not be the best choice for an imbalanced dataset.


Q2. You are working on a sentiment analysis project where the goal is to classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on the text content. You have gathered a dataset of movie reviews labeled with their corresponding sentiment (positive or negative).

You decide to build a machine learning model using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel to perform the sentiment analysis.

However, after training the SVM model and evaluating its performance on a test set, you notice that the accuracy is relatively low and the model is struggling to generalize to new reviews.

Task:
 analyze the possible reasons for the model's subpar performance and propose strategies to improve its accuracy and generalization.
